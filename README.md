# King County Housing Data


## Introduction

In the following project, we will examine and analyze data from housing sales in King County, Washington. We will employ the OSEMN (obtain, scrub, explore, model, and interpret) data science process to determine the effect of various features on housing sales prices via a multivariate linear model.

## Objectives
Throughout this project we will aim to answer the following questions through exploratory analysis:
* How does **living space** affect the selling price of a home?
* How do **zip code** and **location** affect the selling price of a home?
* How do **age** and **time** affect the selling price of a home?
* How does the **ranking** assigned by King County affect a house's value?
* How does the **number of views** a house receives correlate with its value?
* How does the **condition ranting** of a house affect its selling price?

Ultimately our analysis and modeling process will culminate by answering the following essential question:
#### **Which factors most significantly contribute to increased housing value?**

## Final Project Summary

You've made it all the way through the first module of this course - take a minute to celebrate your awesomeness!

All that remains in Module 1 is to put our newfound data science skills to use with a final project! You should expect this project to take between 40 and 50 hours of solid, focused effort. If you're done way quicker, go back and dig in deeper or try some of the optional "level up" suggestions. If you're worried that you're going to get to 30 hrs and still not even have the data imported, reach out to an instructor in slack ASAP to get some help!
