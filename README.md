# King County Housing Data


## Introduction

In the following project, we examine and analyze data to determine the factors that most significantly contriubte to increased housing value. We will employ the OSEMN (obtain, scrub, explore, model, and interpret) data science process to determine the effect of various features on housing sales prices via a multivariate linear model.

The housing data utilized throughout this project comes from King County, Washington (shown below). King County comprises the greater Seattle area, including the city of Seattle and many surrounding suburbs to the North, East, and South. It is the most populous county in the state, with over 2 million residents, and the 12 most populous in the country.

## Objectives
Throughout this project we will aim to answer the following questions through exploratory analysis:
* How does **living space** affect the selling price of a home?
* How do **zip code** and **location** affect the selling price of a home?
* How do **age** and **time** affect the selling price of a home?
* How does the **ranking** assigned by King County affect a house's value?
* How does the **number of views** a house receives correlate with its value?
* How does the **condition ranting** of a house affect its selling price?

Ultimately our analysis and modeling process will culminate by answering the following essential question:
#### **Which factors most significantly contribute to increased housing value?**
